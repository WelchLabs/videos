This project contains the code used to generate the explanatory math videos found on [Welch Labs](https://www.youtube.com/@WelchLabs/).

This almost entirely consists of scenes generated using the library [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim).  See also the community maintained version at [ManimCommunity](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/).

Older projects may have code dependent on older versions of manim, and so may not run out of the box here.

Note, while the library Manim itself is [open source](https://opensource.org/osd) software and under the [MIT license](https://github.com/3b1b/manim/blob/master/LICENSE.md), the contents of this repository are available under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License][cc-by-nc-sa].
